### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 part 1 

    Lab 1 part 1 was one of my favourite labs since it was the very first time I had actually began doing some actual coding before. I had learned a few commands such as git clone and entering our usernames and tokens as the passwords. Also commands such as cd to change my directory to the one I was working on. Another reason why I like this lab was because I got to see how to put code together and do it myself. 

* Lab 

    Lab 4 part 1 was another favourite of mine since I was still getting used to the other commands that were talked about in the README.md file which helped us make sure our code was right and had no errors. Commands such as make which would compile our program and make header to make sure we had no errors in our header. Another thing that I liked about this lab was getting used to makeing headers for each lab and for the future labs. I had gotten used to the format we all followed for making our headers.

* Lab 7 part 1

    Lab 7 part 1 was also a favourite lab for me since it was one of the few times I had to write certain functions such as the PrintDate functions. Im still new to it but getting to try out the functions for my self is something I really enjoyed. I also got to try checking my format through the command make format which helped me correct any errors in my code.
